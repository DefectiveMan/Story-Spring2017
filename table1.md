Stephen Wood:
I am thinking on either extending the functionality of one of various projects I have worked on in the past. Alternatively, I am looking at working on an existing open source project. I have not made steps yet to determine what existing projects I would work on or which old project I would work on.

Samuel Breese:
I will probably work on one of my existing projects, likely [this one](https://github.com/chameco/reliquary).
