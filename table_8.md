I had ideas but I'd probably rather work on someone else's project.
One of them was to make a website where you can look up topic and
find free resources that will teach you that topic, rated by users.
Free resources would include websites, youtube series, and very
helpful blog posts, among other things.

- [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)
- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
