The project I want to work on is https://github.com/isislab/CTFd which is a opensource system for hosting CTF security competitions. I have contributed once in the past once. I have used it a lot, and know the guy who originally wrote it, so I want to give back more and spend some time working on it to improve some of the things I have noticed in the past. The project is mostly python2 and javascript, but also used flask, which I want to get more experience with. They have a slack that I joined as well, so I can communicate with the other developers.
