I want to make a puzzle/card/board game.
The details are not clear as of now.
I want it to be somewhat original.

A friend of mine suggested a project where we created a web app that would
automatically fetch data via online APIs and display them. The first
integrations will be OpenWeatherMap, followed by others. The idea is to deploy
it on a Raspberry Pi and have a monitor from the tech dumps on a bookshelf or
wall as the display. We are using NodeJS and MongoDB.
